# Challenge-03
In this challenge I wanted to see if it was possible to have all the indiviudal prompts of "do you want lower case/ uppercase" etc into one.

I made it extra user friendly so if my user types a repeated number ex"11112" it will still only give them lower and upper as that is 1 and 2's value.

If that user enters something outside of the jurisdictions of the prompt it will return them with either an alert or false in the text box.
